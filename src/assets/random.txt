### Entropy / Seed Generation
The Draw Seed is defined as:

Seed = Intrinsic Seed ⊕ Extrinsic Seed

Intrinsic Seed is:
`Blake2( *TXIDn* || Blake2( *TXIDn-1* || ( Blake2 (*TXIDn-2* || ........*TXID_init*))))`

Where *TXIDn* is the TXid of the transaction where the Ticket n was bought.

Extrinsic Seed is:
The SHA256 hash of the **FIRST** Bitcoin block that meets the following conditions:
  - Block height >= Target Height
  - Block Timestamp >= Target Timestamp
  - Confirmed by at least another block.

where:
   - Target Height = BTC Height at start-date + 1008 (number of blocks expected for 7 days)
   - Target Timestamp = end-date + 2 hours

### Draw
The Smart contract draws 16 potential winning tickets:

`1st = Blake2(Seed ⊕ 1) modulo N`

`2nd = Blake2(Seed ⊕ 2) modulo N`

...

`16st = Blake2(Seed ⊕ 16) modulo N`

(N being the total number of tickets)

After removing duplicates, the 3 first tickets are designed as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd prize. This method prevents a single ticket for winning several prizes.

`Star Number = Blake2(Seed ⊕ 888) modulo 10`
